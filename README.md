# 3D Rubik's Cube Solver

A fun and interactive 3D Rubik's Cube app that helps users solve their real Rubik's Cube by visually matching its colors. The app analyzes the current state of your cube and provides the fastest solution, guiding you step by step while showing the solution dynamically in 3D.

## Features

- **3D Rubik's Cube**: Interact with a 3D Rubik's Cube and match the colors of its faces to reflect the real cube you hold in your hands.
- **Step-by-Step Solution**: Once you've matched the cube, the app will generate the fastest way to solve it and guide you through each step.
- **Real-Time Updates**: As you follow the steps to solve your cube, the 3D model updates accordingly to show the changes in real-time.
- **Online or Local Usage**: Clone the repo to run locally or access the app online through the provided link.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework to build the interactive UI.
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics library used to render the Rubik's Cube.
- **Cube Solving Algorithm**: Algorithm to calculate the most efficient solution for solving the Rubik's Cube.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:

    npm run dev
5. Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:5173.

## Usage

1. Open the app and you'll see a 3D Rubik's Cube.

2. Match the colors of the cube faces to those of the real cube you're holding.

3. Once the cube is matched, the app will generate the fastest solution and show it step by step.

4. Follow the steps and see the cube change in real-time as you progress through the solution.
